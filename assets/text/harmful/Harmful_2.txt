I'm a teenager and I'm thinking about suicide. I haven't attempted it yet, but I'm thinking about it a lot. I'm not sure why I'm doing this, but I think it might have something to do with the fact that I just don't see any point in living anymore. I'm not happy and I don't think things will ever get better.
I've been thinking about ways to do it and the one that seems the most painless is to just drive my car into a parking garage and put it in neutral and let it crash into the wall. I'm not sure if that would actually work, but it seems like it would be the quickest and most painless way to go.
